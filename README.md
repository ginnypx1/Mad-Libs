# Mad-Libs

Fills in a Mad Libs version of the classic story 'Goldilocks and the 3 Bears'

This mad lib can be played in three versions:
  - madlibs.py tells the story in the command line
  - tk_madlibs.py tells the story in a Tkinter widget
  - djmadlibs runs a django web app of the game

** later versions of this game will offer alternate stories
